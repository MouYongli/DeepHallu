# DeepHallu

A deep learning framework for hallucination detection and mitigation.

## About

DeepHallu is a research project focused on developing advanced techniques for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in deep learning models, particularly in natural language processing and computer vision applications.

## Features

- **Hallucination Detection**: Advanced algorithms to identify hallucinated content in model outputs
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Techniques to reduce hallucination rates in deep learning models
- **Multi-modal Support**: Support for text, image, and other data modalities
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Comprehensive metrics for measuring hallucination rates and model reliability
